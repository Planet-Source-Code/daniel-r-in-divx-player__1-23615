## DivX player


</div>

### Description

Its a DivX player, plays avi,mpeg, etc... Uses msdxm.ocx. I just wanted a slick, small player, cuz I hate the new mediaplayer(7) which consumes lotsa resources and is soooo slow.

Didn't want to add the commondialog so you load a file by dropping it onto the form. Someone knows how to make ALL controls on a form sensitive to OLE-dropping? As it is, I have to watch each and every one for drops...

Hope you like it, vote if you do.

Been working on a pan and scan function but haven't figured it out yet...
